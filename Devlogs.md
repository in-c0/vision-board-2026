TODO:

almost done; now set up a help email, discord server and a website to deploy, and start going live.

i am trying to launch a web vision board app and build a community around health/tech/self-help. Is there a good way for me to gather users and their feedback straight to Discord server. ideally i want ppl tobe able to write Feedback form straight in the web app and sending it triggers a message in the discord server?

Spawn new cards with a little bit of randomness (position, rotation) - ideally the position of the new card should be somewhere empty near existing card.


Allow user to set upto 25 custom boards and save it. Allow user to select the "Default board" to open upon page visit. 
For this, we'll create a vertical bar to the left side of the page. This bar shows the boards the user has created. Upon first page arrival to a new user is just the one ready-made Vision Board. There is a button undernath the existing vision board that is shaped like an empty board with dotted outlines with a + button in the middle (Create New Board). This is where Onboarding tooltips will show up. Users can skip this. They can delete the template by hovering over a template and clicking on the delete button that appears to the top right corner of the template.

What is this space?

This space is for creating your Vision Board.

A vision board is a personal roadmap—a way to clarify what you want and stay connected to it over time. It can include images, words, quotes, affirmations, videos, or ideas that reflect your direction.

Because this is digital, you can:

Add images (or videos) from Pinterest

Log in with Google to save history and revisit past boards

Watch how your vision evolves over time

Use templates and add-ons created by the community to make the process more creative and enjoyable

This isn’t just about collecting inspiration—it’s about seeing your future more clearly.

Why should I do this?

Vision boards aren’t magic—but they do work when used intentionally.

They’re grounded in psychology:

Visualization helps strengthen mental pathways

Priming makes you more likely to notice relevant opportunities

Repetition reduces fear and friction around new actions

Like mental training used by athletes, vision boards support focus and motivation—especially when you pair them with real action and values you care about.

How do I make a Vision Board?

There’s no single right way.

A common approach:

Add images or words that resonate with you

Place them freely on the board

Flip cards to reflect on meaning using a template

Revisit and evolve the board over time

Digital boards make it easy to experiment:

One board for the year

Monthly boards (e.g. “February Vision Board”)

Revision boards to reflect on how things actually unfolded

You can even add real photos and notes later, turning your boards into a visual journal of your life.

Try different templates and find what works for you.
