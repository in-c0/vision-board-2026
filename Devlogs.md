Let's add an onboarding tutorial. It's just an animated popup with 'don't show this again' option and a close button.  It explains: Select a card, then drag to move. / Rotate/resize by click and dragging the relative UI.  / Double-click on the card to flip. / Pan the board by click and dragging with a mouse wheel, or alternatively just click+drag while holding the Ctrl key. / Zoom in and out by scrolling up/down with mouse while holding Ctrl key, or by clicking on the +/- UI.
(maybe animated as GIF)

Let's add Versioning (v0.01, v0.02, ...) with update history logs. These logs should be visible by clicking on the version displayed in the footer.
Make this current one v0.01 - Briefly introduce what we have made so far.

For v0.02, we're going to implement Auto-save. We will display in top left corner "Saved at {DateTime}" and "Saved History". This should save all settings, custom text, card placements, linked or uploaded images, as-is. Auto-save is triggered once every 30 seconds. If any metadata change is detected, it will save the checkpoint in Saved History.

For v0.03 - we're going to implement "Log in with Google". At first page visit, if not logged in already, we will show a pop-up near the Log In button: "Log in with Google to auto-save and sync"

Alert / Notifications? (Maybe Premium)


Fetch Pinterest has problems (No media found)... it doesn't fetch a video pin.

If the image has been loaded/fetched and custom text has not been set, (i.e. "New Intention") remove the text.

Add Font stylization (Bold, Italic, Underline)

Spawn new cards with a little bit of randomness (position, rotation) - ideally the position of the new card should be somewhere empty near existing card.

Allow user to set upto 10 custom boards and save it. Allow user to select the "Default board" to open upon page visit.
